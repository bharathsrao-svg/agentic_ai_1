To provide a detailed, structured analysis of your portfolio holdings including 1-year returns, holding values, and buy/sell/retain recommendations, I will outline the approach and key insights based on your portfolio data and best financial advisory practices. Note that explicit 1-year returns for each holding are not available in your data or search results; thus, I will explain how to obtain them and proceed with valuation and recommendation based on sector exposure, diversification, and risk considerations.

### 1. **1-Year Returns for Each Holding**

- **Current data limitation:** Your portfolio summary and holdings list do not include historical prices or performance data necessary to calculate 1-year returns.
- **How to obtain:** Use a reliable financial data source or platform (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance, brokerage account reports) to retrieve the price of each security exactly one year ago and compare to current prices.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{1-Year Return} = \frac{\text{Current Price} - \text{Price 1 Year Ago}}{\text{Price 1 Year Ago}} \times 100\%
  \]
- For ETFs, check the NAV or market price; for stocks, use closing prices.

*Without this data, performance evaluation is incomplete but can be supplemented by sector and qualitative analysis.*

### 2. **Holding Value and Portfolio Allocation**

- **Total Portfolio Value:** \$6,789,516.94
- **Average Holding Value:** \$154,307.20 (approximate)

| Sector                     | Holdings | Sector Value (USD) | % of Portfolio |
|----------------------------|----------|--------------------|----------------|
| ETF                        | 8        | 3,590,860.70       | 52.9%          |
| Financial Services         | 8        | 689,706.15         | 10.2%          |
| Engineering & Capital Goods| 6        | 588,322.42         | 8.7%           |
| Auto Ancillary             | 5        | 488,367.75         | 7.2%           |
| FMCG                      | 2        | 338,717.20         | 5.0%           |
| Energy                    | 4        | 244,612.30         | 3.6%           |
| Trading                   | 1        | 242,290.40         | 3.6%           |
| Metals                    | 1        | 241,368.21         | 3.6%           |
| Healthcare                | 3        | 139,775.50         | 2.1%           |
| Others (Textiles, Telecom, Software Services, Real Estate, Unlisted) | 7 | 225,599.21 | 3.3% |

- The portfolio has a **heavy allocation towards ETFs (52.9%)**, which provide diversification and risk mitigation.
- Next significant allocations are to Financial Services (10.2%), Engineering & Capital Goods (8.7%), and Auto Ancillary (7.2%), indicating sector concentration worth monitoring.
- Smaller exposure to Healthcare, Energy, Metals, Telecom, and Real Estate suggests some diversification but potential gaps in sector balance.

### 3. **Recommendations: Buy, Sell, or Retain**

Recommendations are based on typical portfolio management principles, sector balance, diversification, and implied risk-return trade-offs in the absence of specific return data.

| Sector / Holding Type     | Recommendation Basis                                                                 | Suggested Action                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **ETFs (52.9%)**         | ETFs provide broad market exposure and reduce single-stock risk. High concentration; review ETF types for overlap. | *Retain*, consider slight trimming if overweight in similar ETFs to diversify further. |
| **Financial Services**   | Important sector but watch exposure to banking and financials; diversify across sub-sectors and quality. | *Retain*, consider selective buying if individual stocks have strong fundamentals and valuation. |
| **Engineering & Capital Goods** | Moderate exposure; cyclical sector with growth potential but sensitive to economic cycles. | *Retain* if fundamentals strong, consider *sell* if weak earnings or high valuation. |
| **Auto Ancillary**       | Exposure to automotive supply chain; cyclical with economic sensitivity.             | *Retain* with monitoring of industry trends; consider *reduce* if high volatility or poor performance. |
| **FMCG**                | Defensive sector; steady cash flows and dividends.                                 | *Buy* or *retain* for stability, especially if valuation attractive. |
| **Energy**              | Moderate exposure; depends on commodity price cycles and geopolitical factors.     | *Hold* if portfolio risk tolerant; consider *sell* if seeking lower volatility. |
| **Trading, Metals, Healthcare, Telecom, Software, Real Estate** | Smaller holdings; evaluate individually based on fundamentals and growth outlook. | *Retain* unless fundamental or valuation concerns emerge; consider *buy* selectively in growth sectors like Healthcare and Software. |
| **Unlisted**            | Currently zero value; evaluate potential or divest if no value expected.            | *Sell* or *review* for clarity on value. |

### 4. **Additional Portfolio Considerations**

- **Diversification:** The portfolio is diversified across 44 holdings and multiple sectors, but ETFs dominate. Ensure ETFs do not overly overlap in holdings.
- **Risk Exposure:** Heavy concentration in ETFs lowers single-stock risk, but sector concentration in Financials and Engineering could increase cyclical risk.
- **Liquidity:** Most holdings appear liquid; unlisted holding should be reviewed for liquidity risk.
- **Valuation and Fundamentals:** Recommend reviewing P/E, P/B, dividend yields, and company financial health for each stock to refine buy/sell decisions.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax implications of selling holdings, especially ETFs and long-term holdings.

### 5. **Next Steps for Comprehensive Analysis**

- Retrieve and calculate 1-year returns for each holding.
- Analyze fundamental and technical indicators for individual stocks.
- Review ETF compositions to avoid duplication.
- Align portfolio with your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.
- Consider rebalancing to maintain desired asset allocation and sector weights.
- Consult with a financial advisor or use portfolio analytics tools (e.g., Vanguard, BlackRock, J.P. Morgan tools) for stress testing and scenario analysis[1][2][3][4][6].
